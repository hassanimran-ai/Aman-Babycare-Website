## Checklist for every photo
- Modest: women in hijab or covered; no bare shoulders, no tight clothing.
- The setting reads as a Gulf/Saudi home or neutral (no snow, no Western holiday decor, no alcohol, no musical instruments).
- Bright, warm, natural light. No heavy filters. No overlays on card photos (only behind hero text if needed).
- Children look calm and happy, never distressed.
- No visible third-party logos or watermarks.

## Sources
- Client-supplied AI-generated photos (Google Gemini), approved Oct 2026. Each must pass the checklist above. They are illustrations: never caption or describe them as real staff, real clients or "our team".
- Free-for-commercial-use stock (Unsplash, Pexels).
- Record every file in `src/assets/photos/CREDITS.md` with source, author and licence.
If no fitting photo exists, use a branded illustration panel. Never fill a gap with an off-culture photo.

## Technical
- Files in `src/assets/photos/`, served through Astro `<Picture>` (AVIF + WebP) with width/height.
- Hero image: `loading="eager"` + `fetchpriority="high"`; everything else lazy.

## Alt text
In the page's language, describing what is shown ("A mother in a hijab holding her sleeping baby"). Decorative images get `alt=""`.
