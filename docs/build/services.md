# Services

The site's services are the **"Other services"** block of `brand_assets/reference-homepage-mockup.jpeg`. Source of truth: `mainServices` in `src/config/site.ts`; page content in `src/data/services.ts`.

- **Order and tiers are client-approved** (Oct 2026): the three core services lead as large cards; the other three sit in a smaller "More help at home" row (`tier` in `src/data/services.ts`). The mock-up's "Other services" row repeats "More services", so it is not built twice.
- Each service has its own page at `/services/<slug>/` (Arabic) and `/en/services/<slug>/`.
- One caregiver can combine several services; this is sold through bundles and the bundle builder.
- **Newborn & Mother Care** (client request, Oct 2026) is the mock-up's top "Newborn Care at Home" block: one combined page with its sub-services (newborn care at home, feeding support, baby bathing & hygiene, sleep & comfort, mother & baby support, baby shower & welcoming guests) listed in `subservices`. It shows as a wide featured card above the core row. Help and companionship only: never call it nursing, medical or clinical care.
